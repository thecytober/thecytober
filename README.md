I am TheCytober, also known as Cyto, Zyth, Centurion, and Rezyn.

I make plenty of things I keep to myself. Stories, systems, or utilities.
Mostly unique. I'm very intrested in making things that abandon current established forms for something entierly unique.
Ternary, Analog, Disorganized Neural Networks, Enviroment-based models.

You can find me on X (Twitter), Discord, Gmail, Email, FA, and probably somewhere else. In order;

	-(This one's academic, sorry)
	-(I'm not sharing my goddamn FA here, are you nuts?)
 
	Kind regards,
 		Cyto.
